coretemp-sensors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Naive script to output coretemp sysfs data per-CPU core.

I've been using lm_sensors for a while to monitor current CPU core temp.
However, I wasn't very much impressed with sensors memory usage
		 VIRT:51156 RES:38m SHR:1256
so I came up with easy and light script, that fulfills my needs.


- Temp data output is in Celsius units.

- Script works only with coretemp sysfs attributes and doesn't perform any
	CPUID based discover/lookup. It's been only tested on Intel CPU and as a
	result has explicit check for vendor_id GenuineIntel and cpu family >= 6,
	which some of you may find moronic.

If, for some reason, script doesn't fit your requirements, please consider
either (or both):
-- use lm_sensors;
-- send me a patch.


usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

coretemp-sensors [-t timeout] [-c]
	-t: loop mode with timeout seconds sleep
	-c: clear screen before reporting


-ss
